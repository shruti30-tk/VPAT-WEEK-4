Custom PoC Summary:

A Python Proof-of-Concept exploit from Exploit-DB can be modified by adjusting buffer size, return address offsets, and payload structure. Such changes help improve exploit reliability, adapt the exploit to different environments, and bypass basic security protections. This demonstrates understanding of exploit customization and vulnerability exploitation techniques.
